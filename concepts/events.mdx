Events are the primary concept on Sailhouse. The container, envelope, metaphor of choice for your data.

## Summary

Events are JSON objects that get sent to a topic. You can't send an event to multiple topics, but you can send multiple events with the same data to multiple topics (although, that is likely an anti-pattern).

## Publishing events

Sending, or publishing, and event is the first step in communicating with your application.


```ts
client.publish("some-topic", {
    some: "property",
});
```

As mentioned above, an event must be sent to a topic. This directs your event to downstream subscribers, and acts as a "bucket" that your different types of events can live in. To read more fun things about topics, head over to [their concepts section](/concepts/topics).

## Limitations

For non-enterprise customers, there is a maximum event size of **4mb** applied. However, if you're hitting this limitation it's likely an anti-pattern.

## Metadata

Events can have metadata attached to them. For attaching trace-ids
