Events are the primary concept on Sailhouse. The container, envelope, metaphor of choice for your data.

## Summary

Events are JSON objects that get sent to a topic. You can't send an event to multiple topics, but you can send multiple events with the same data to multiple topics (although, that is likely an anti-pattern).

## Publishing events

Sending, or publishing, and event is the first step in communicating with your application.


```ts
client.publish("some-topic", {
    some: "property",
});
```

As mentioned above, an event must be sent to a topic. This directs your event to downstream subscribers, and acts as a "bucket" that your different types of events can live in. To read more fun things about topics, head over to [their concepts section](/concepts/topics).

### Scheduling events

You can schedule an event to be sent at a future time for a topic. This can be _any_ time in the future, and the event will not be sent to subscribers until that date.

<Warning>
The scheduled event will be sent to all subscribers present when it is scheduled for. If you add a subscriber inbetween after it has been sent, but before the scheduled time, it will be sent to that subscription.

<Tab title='TypeScript'>
```ts
client.publish('reminder-queue', {
    user_id: '123'
}, {
    date: new Date() // some future date
})
```
</Tab>
<Tab title='Go'>
```go
err := client.Publish(
    ctx,
    "reminder-queue",
    data,
    // 5 days in the future
    sailhouse.WithScheduledTime(time.Now().Add(time.Hour * 24 * 5)),
)
```
</Tab>

## Limitations

For non-enterprise customers, there is a maximum event size of **4mb** applied. However, if you're hitting this limitation it's likely an anti-pattern.

## Metadata
<Note>
This is currently in-development and not available for public access.
</Note>

Events can have metadata attached to them. For attaching trace-ids
