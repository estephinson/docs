title: Scheduling Events
description: Queue up future work
---

You can schedule events to be processed a time after they're sent. This can be done at either for a given event, or a subscription, depending on your needs.

## Topics

To scheduled event to a topic, you can set a property when publishing the event to define the exact time for the event to be sent to all subscribers.

This is often useful for scheduling a future job, for example processing a payment 14 days after an order, or sending a reminder of a task that is due.

<Tabs>
<Tab title='TypeScript'>
```ts
const now = new Date();
const due = addDays(now, 14);

await client.publish('send-payment-invoice', {
    customer_id: 'cust_123',
    invoice_id: 'inv_321',
}, {
    date: due
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab title='Go'>
```go
data := SendPaymentInvoiceEvent{
    CustomerID: "cust_123",
    InvoiceID: "inv_321",
}

err := client.Publish(
    ctx,
    "send-payment-invoice",
    data,
    sailhouse.WithScheduledTime(time.Now().Add(time.Hour * 24 * 14)),
)
```
</Tab>

## Subscriptions

<Info>
This feature is currently in **private** beta, to enable, please [contact us](mailto:support@sailhouse.dev).
</Info>

You can also define an offset on a given subscription. This is more in tradition with a pub/sub application, but Sailhouse is more than flexible enough to accomodate any pattern.

### Offset

For a given subscription, you can set a _fixed_ value of time to delay the processing of an event within a subscription.

Taking the same pattern as above, where we want to send an invoice after 14 days, you could create a `send-payment-invoice` subscription on a `order-made` topic, and configure it's offset to be 14 days.

This is available for both `push` and `pull` subscriptions, but **not** for any integration subscriptions such as Slack.
