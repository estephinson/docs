description: Get up to speed on handling events from push subscriptions

Push subscriptions allow you to receive a `POST` request from Sailhouse when you send an event to a topic. They're great for serverless applications, hosted on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare or Google Cloud Run.

## Push

```ts
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post("/api/send-welcome-email", async (req, res) => {
    const event = req.body;
})
```

### Security

To ensure the request has come from Sailhouse, you can check the `sh-signature` header of the incoming request against the Signature visible in your app settings.

<Warning>
This is a sensitive value that should not be publically available. You can always re-generate this signature.
</Warning>

To view your app's signature in [the dashboard](https://app.sailhouse.dev), navigate to **Home** -> **Apps** -> _Select your app_ -> **Settings**.

Use this value within your application, as you would with any other secret. This could be via environment variables, or a managed solution like Google Secrets Manager.

```ts
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post("/api/send-welcome-email", async (req, res) => {
    const event = req.body;
    const shSignature = req.headers['sh-signature'];
    const sailhouseSignature = process.env.SAILHOUSE_SIGNATURE;

    if (shSignature !== sailhouseSignature) {
        return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
    }

    // ...
})
```

<Note>
If Sailhouse receives a `403` in response to a push subscription endpoint, it will retry as normal before placing in the Dead Letter Queue.
</Note>

### Considerations

### Timeout

Sailhouse will consider, and then cancel, a request if it is taking long than 5 seconds. This is configurable up to 15 minutes via [contacting support](mailto:support@sailhouse.dev).

### Payload size

Sailhouse has a limitation of 4MB when receiving events, so your application should be able to process requests of that size.

## Pull

Pull subscriptions allow your application to "pull" directly from Sailhouse on it's own schedule. This could be a continuous process where you receive events as soon as they're in, or even a scheduled job where you process events in bulk.
