title: Sending events
---

The best way to send events on Sailhouse is via our language-native SDKs. These wrap around our core HTTP APIs, and include some useful functionality such as streaming and batching.

### Publishing events

Sending, or publishing, and event is the first step in communicating with your application.

<Tabs>
<Tab title='TypeScript / JavaScript'>
```ts
await client.publish("some-topic", {
    some: "property",
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab title='Go'>
```go
client.Publish("some-topic", map[string]string{
    "some": "property"
})
```
</Tab>
<Tab title='Rust'>
```rust
let mut data = HashMap::new();
data.insert("message", "Hello world!");

let publish_future = client.publish("example-topic", data);
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

As mentioned above, an event must be sent to a topic. This directs your event to downstream subscribers, and acts as a "bucket" that your different types of events can live in. To read more fun things about topics, head over to [their concepts section](/concepts/topics).

Once an event is in a topic, it is sent to all the subscriptions of a topic. Say you have a `user-created` event, which you send when someone signs up to your application. You may have some subscriptions like `send-welcome-email` and `check-spam-score`. These subscriptions will both get a copy of the event, where it will sit until acknowledged in future.

#### Scheduling events

You can schedule an event to be sent at a future time for a topic. This can be _any_ time in the future, and the event will not be sent to subscribers until that date.

<Warning>
The scheduled event will be sent to all subscribers present when it is scheduled for. If you add a subscriber inbetween after it has been sent, but before the scheduled time, it will be sent to that subscription.

<Tab title='TypeScript'>
```ts
client.publish('reminder-queue', {
    user_id: '123'
}, {
    date: new Date() // some future date
})
```
</Tab>
<Tab title='Go'>
```go
err := client.Publish(
    ctx,
    "reminder-queue",
    data,
    // 5 days in the future
    sailhouse.WithScheduledTime(time.Now().Add(time.Hour * 24 * 5)),
)
```
